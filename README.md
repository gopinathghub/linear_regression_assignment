# Build Linear Regression Machine Learning Model
Building a linear regression machine learning model to predict the demand for bike sharing with the available independant variables.

## General Information
- We need to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables, so that the company can use it to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features and accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels. Further, the model will be a good way for the company to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. The model should be built taking 'cnt' as the target variable from the dataset.
- The input dataset is 'day.csv'
- The target variable is 'cnt'

## Python Packages Used
- numpy
- pandas
- seabord
- sklearn
- statsmodels
